# Talk track

One credential minted once and held for 30 days; one minted per call for 300 seconds, bound to a single tool. Same attacker, same capture. The banner stays on screen, also in presenter mode.

- **standing The standing credential.** Minted once, held for 30 days, reused on every call. Convenient - and every day it lives is a day a captured copy works.
- **jit The JIT credential.** Minted per call, 300 seconds, bound to one tool. The captured copy is dead within minutes; the fresh one cannot be replayed against a different tool.
- **replay The replay.** Drag the capture age from minutes to hours. The standing credential keeps being accepted the whole time. That is the whole problem in one slider.
- **revocation Revocation.** Revoke the tool at the issuer: even a fresh JIT credential is refused. Short TTL limits the window; revocation closes it.

Revoke the tool at the issuer and show that even a fresh JIT credential is refused: TTL and revocation are independent controls.
